1.      Implement an entity that will be used to store contacts in the phone. A contact is a pair of phone-name values, for example "89003337788 - Tom".

One contact can correspond to several different phone numbers.

You can add a new contact. If you try to add an existing contact, nothing changes.

You can find a phone by specifying the name of a contact. If there is no such contact, null is returned. If there is a contact, an array of phone numbers is returned.

You can get an array of all contacts by specifying part of the name.



2.      Implement a hierarchy of geometric shapes classes in a flat coordinate system - point, line, circle, triangle, square, rectangle, parallelogram.

Each entity must be specified with the minimal required number of parameters and have methods that return its parameters - the type of the figure, the length of the lines it consists of (constant 0 for a point, length for a line, circumference for a circle, perimeter for the rest), area (constant 0 for a point and a line). You need to create a collection (array) of different shapes and in the loop display its parameters in the console.



3.      Develop your own class that can be used as an enumeration.
